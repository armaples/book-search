## Description
This application allows users to create an account where they can search for books via GoogleBooks and add them to their collection. Once the books are added to the collection, the user has the ability to delete books from the collection. This application was refactored to utilize the MERN stack with a React frontend, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
